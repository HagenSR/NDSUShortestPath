# NDSUShortestPath
An app that finds the path with the shortest distance traveled outside on the NDSU campus.

## A few things to know about this program
###1. output.txt describes the paths you should take, given a starting building and an ending building
####  a. It's not very useful right now, because it doesn't describe in detail which door/skyway/tunnel you need to take to avoid going outside.
###2. Residence halls have been left out for now. This is because only residents can enter them, making them untraversable for most students
###3. A solid understanding of the NDSU campus is needed to use this app
###4. Distances were collected from google maps. Distances of 0 in the GraphCSV.csv file indicate that a building can be traveled to without going outside
###5. I hope to make this information more accessable and understandable in the future. I plan on doing this by creating a website with google maps api 
      that shows the routes you need to take on the map.
